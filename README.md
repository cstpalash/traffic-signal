## 🏆 Live Coding Challenge

### 🎯 **Main Goal**: AI-Powered Traffic Management System

Your task is to build an **intelligent traffic management system** that prevents vehicle collisions through advanced conflict detection, predictive analysis, and adaptive signal optimization.

### 📚 Understanding Traffic Conflicts in 4-Point Junction

In a 4-way intersection with **left-side driving**, understanding precise conflict patterns is critical for AI-powered management.

#### **Movement Patterns (Left-Side Driving)**:
```
From North: East=Left, South=Straight, West=Right
From East:  South=Left, West=Straight, North=Right  
From South: West=Left, North=Straight, East=Right
From West:  North=Left, East=Straight, South=Right
```

#### **Detailed Conflict Analysis Examples:**

##### **Example 1: South Left Turn Active**
```
Signal State: South = [Green, Red, Red] (Left turn ON)
```
**✅ Allowed Movement:**
- South → West (left turn) 

**❌ Conflicting Signals (Must be RED):**
- **North Right (North → West)**: Same destination path conflict
- **East Straight (East → West)**: Same destination path conflict

**✅ Compatible Signals (Can be GREEN simultaneously):**
- North Left (North → East)
- North Straight (North → South)  
- East Left (East → South)
- East Right (East → North)
- South Straight (South → North)
- South Right (South → East)
- West Left (West → North)
- West Straight (West → East)
- West Right (West → South)

##### **Example 2: South Right Turn Active**
```
Signal State: South = [Red, Red, Green] (Right turn ON)
```
**✅ Allowed Movement:**
- South → East (right turn)

**✅ Simultaneously Compatible Movements:**
- **West Left (West → North)**: Non-conflicting path
- **North Right (North → West)**: Non-conflicting path  
- **East Left (East → South)**: Non-conflicting path

**❌ Conflicting Signals (Must be RED):**
- **North Left (North → East)**: Same destination conflict
- **West Straight (West → East)**: Same destination conflict
- **West Right (West → South)**: Crossing path conflict
- **East Straight (East → West)**: Crossing path conflict
- **East Right (East → North)**: Crossing path conflict
- **North Straight (North → South)**: Crossing path conflict
- **South Left (South → West)**: Same origin conflict
- **South Straight (South → North)**: Same origin conflict

#### **Conflict Categories for AI Analysis:**

1. **Same Destination Conflicts**: Multiple vehicles targeting same road
2. **Same Origin Conflicts**: Multiple signals from same road simultaneously  
3. **Crossing Path Conflicts**: Vehicle paths intersect in junction center
4. **Head-on Conflicts**: Direct collision risk on same road segment

### 🧠 **Implementation Tasks** (90-120 minutes)

#### **Phase 1: Intelligent Conflict Detection **
**Goal**: Build comprehensive conflict analysis system

**Tasks**:
1. **Create Conflict Matrix**: Map all 48 possible signal combinations (4 roads × 3 directions × 4 states)
2. **Implement Smart Detection**: 
   ```javascript
   detectConflicts(activeSignals) {
       // Analyze same-destination conflicts
       // Analyze crossing-path conflicts  
       // Analyze same-origin conflicts
       // Return detailed conflict report
   }
   ```
3. **Real-time Conflict Monitoring**: Continuous conflict assessment
4. **Visual Conflict Indicators**: Color-coded conflict status display


### 🎯 **AI Algorithm Requirements**

#### **Conflict Detection Algorithm**
```javascript
class TrafficAI {
    buildConflictMatrix() {
        // Define all 16 possible conflicts for each signal
        // Same-destination: signals targeting same road
        // Crossing-path: signals with intersecting vehicle paths
        // Return comprehensive conflict mapping
    }
    
    predictConflicts(proposedChange, currentState) {
        // Simulate proposed signal change
        // Calculate collision probability
        // Return safety assessment and recommendations
    }
    
    optimizeSignalTiming(trafficData) {
        // Analyze current traffic density
        // Calculate optimal signal durations
        // Balance throughput vs safety
        // Return optimized timing strategy
    }
}
```
