## 🏆 The Challenge

### 🎯 **Goal**: Traffic Signal Conflict Management

Build a **robust conflict management system** that ensures safe and faster travel through the intersection.

### 📚 Understanding Traffic Conflicts

#### **Movement Patterns (Left-Side Driving)**:
```
From North: East=Left, South=Straight, West=Right
From East:  South=Left, West=Straight, North=Right  
From South: West=Left, North=Straight, East=Right
From West:  North=Left, East=Straight, South=Right
```

#### **Conflict Types to Handle:**

##### **Example 1: Same Destination Conflict**
```
Signal State: South = [Green, Red, Red] (Left turn ON)
```
**✅ Allowed Movement:**
- South → West (left turn) 

**❌ Conflicting Signals:**
- **North Right (North → West)**: Same destination conflict
- **East Straight (East → West)**: Same destination conflict

##### **Example 2: Multiple Signal Conflict**
```
Signal State: South = [Red, Red, Green] (Right turn ON)
```
**✅ Allowed Movement:**
- South → East (right turn)

**✅ Compatible Movements (Can run simultaneously):**
- **West Left (West → North)**: Non-conflicting path
- **North Right (North → West)**: Non-conflicting path  
- **East Left (East → South)**: Non-conflicting path

**❌ Conflicting Signals (Must be RED):**
- **North Left (North → East)**: Same destination conflict
- **West Straight (West → East)**: Same destination conflict
- **Multiple crossing path conflicts**

#### **Key Conflict Categories:**
1. **Same Destination Conflicts**: Multiple vehicles targeting same road
2. **Same Origin Conflicts**: Multiple signals from same road  
3. **Crossing Path Conflicts**: Vehicle paths intersect in junction
4. **Head-on Conflicts**: Direct collision risk

## 💻 Implementation Challenge

### 🛠️ **Your Task**: Build Conflict Management System

#### **Core Requirements**:
1. **Conflict Detection**: Identify when signals create dangerous situations
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Block unsafe signal combinations
3. **Traffic Optimization**: Ensure faster, smoother traffic flow
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous safety assessment

#### **Implementation Steps**:

**Step 1: Build Conflict Matrix** (30 mins)
```javascript
detectConflicts(activeSignals) {
    // Analyze same-destination conflicts
    // Analyze crossing-path conflicts  
    // Return conflict details
}
```

**Step 2: Implement Prevention** (30 mins)
```javascript
canActivateSignal(road, direction) {
    // Validate signal safety
    // Return true/false with reasoning
}
```

**Step 3: Optimize Flow** (30 mins)
```javascript
optimizeTrafficFlow() {
    // Balance safety and efficiency
    // Minimize wait times
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your System

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Conflict Test**: Activate conflicting signals and verify prevention
2. **Multi-Signal Test**: Test multiple compatible signals simultaneously  
3. **Flow Optimization**: Measure traffic efficiency improvements
4. **Edge Cases**: Test rapid signal changes and heavy traffic

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **Zero Collisions**: No vehicle conflicts occur
- ✅ **Conflict Detection**: System identifies all dangerous combinations
- ✅ **Flow Optimization**: Reduced average wait times
- ✅ **System Stability**: Robust operation under all conditions
