## üèÜ Marathahalli Junction AI Challenge

### üéØ **Main Goal**: Bangalore Traffic AI Management System

Build an **intelligent traffic management system** specifically designed for Bangalore's chaotic traffic patterns, handling the unique challenges of Marathahalli Junction during peak IT office hours.

### ÔøΩ Understanding Marathahalli Traffic Patterns

#### **Peak Hour Challenges (7-10 AM, 6-9 PM)**:
- **IT Shuttle Buses**: Priority routing for employee transport
- **Auto-rickshaws**: Unpredictable lane changes and U-turns
- **Two-wheelers**: Lane splitting and aggressive maneuvers  
- **Private Cars**: Office commuters heading to tech parks
- **BMTC Buses**: Public transport with frequent stops

#### **Road Directions (Marathahalli Junction)**:
```
North (Whitefield Road): ‚Üí IT Parks, ITPL, Prestige Tech Park
East (Varthur Road): ‚Üí Brookefield, Kundalahalli, HAL
South (Outer Ring Road): ‚Üí Sarjapur, Electronic City, Koramangala  
West (Airport Road): ‚Üí Bangalore Airport, Hennur, Hebbal
```

#### **Traffic Movement Patterns (Left-Side Driving)**:
```
From Whitefield Road: Varthur=Left, ORR=Straight, Airport=Right
From Varthur Road: ORR=Left, Airport=Straight, Whitefield=Right  
From ORR: Airport=Left, Whitefield=Straight, Varthur=Right
From Airport Road: Whitefield=Left, Varthur=Straight, ORR=Right
```

#### **Bangalore-Specific Conflict Analysis:**

##### **Example 1: ORR Left Turn Active (Peak Hour)**
```
Signal State: ORR = [Green, Red, Red] (Left turn to Airport Road)
Scenario: IT employees heading to airport/north Bangalore
```
**‚úÖ Allowed Movement:**
- ORR ‚Üí Airport Road (office commuters, airport travelers)

**‚ùå Conflicting Signals (Rush Hour Chaos):**
- **Whitefield Right (Whitefield ‚Üí Airport)**: Same destination conflict
- **Varthur Straight (Varthur ‚Üí Airport)**: Same destination conflict

**üöå Special Considerations:**
- BMTC bus priority from Whitefield Road
- Auto-rickshaw unpredictable lane changes
- Two-wheeler aggressive filtering
- **East Straight (East ‚Üí West)**: Same destination path conflict

**‚úÖ Compatible Signals (Can be GREEN simultaneously):**
- North Left (North ‚Üí East)
- North Straight (North ‚Üí South)  
- East Left (East ‚Üí South)
- East Right (East ‚Üí North)
- South Straight (South ‚Üí North)
- South Right (South ‚Üí East)
- West Left (West ‚Üí North)
- West Straight (West ‚Üí East)
- West Right (West ‚Üí South)

##### **Example 2: Whitefield Right Turn Active (Morning Rush)**
```
Signal State: Whitefield = [Red, Red, Green] (Right turn to Airport Road)
Scenario: IT employees heading to north Bangalore/airport
```
**‚úÖ Allowed Movement:**
- Whitefield ‚Üí Airport Road (morning commute, flight travelers)

**‚úÖ Simultaneously Compatible Movements (Bangalore Traffic Flow):**
- **Airport Left (Airport ‚Üí Whitefield)**: Return journey, non-conflicting
- **ORR Right (ORR ‚Üí Airport)**: Electronic City to airport traffic  
- **Varthur Left (Varthur ‚Üí ORR)**: Brookefield to south Bangalore

**‚ùå Conflicting Signals (Traffic Chaos Points):**
- **ORR Left (ORR ‚Üí Airport)**: Same destination - creates airport road congestion
- **Airport Straight (Airport ‚Üí Varthur)**: Crossing path through junction center
- **Airport Right (Airport ‚Üí ORR)**: Crossing path conflict
- **Varthur Straight (Varthur ‚Üí Airport)**: Same destination conflict  
- **Varthur Right (Varthur ‚Üí Whitefield)**: Crossing path conflict
- **Whitefield Left (Whitefield ‚Üí Varthur)**: Same origin conflict
- **Whitefield Straight (Whitefield ‚Üí ORR)**: Same origin conflict

#### **Bangalore Traffic Conflict Categories:**

1. **Peak Hour Destination Conflicts**: Multiple routes to same tech park/area
2. **Same Origin Rush**: Multiple signals from same road during office hours
3. **Junction Center Conflicts**: Vehicle paths crossing in Marathahalli center
4. **BMTC Bus Priority Conflicts**: Public transport vs private vehicle conflicts
5. **Two-wheeler Lane Conflicts**: Bikes filtering through car traffic
6. **Auto-rickshaw U-turn Conflicts**: Unpredictable three-wheeler maneuvers  
3. **Crossing Path Conflicts**: Vehicle paths intersect in junction center
4. **Head-on Conflicts**: Direct collision risk on same road segment
